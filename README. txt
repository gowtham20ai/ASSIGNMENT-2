The DOCTYPE in HTML is a declaration at the very top of an HTML document that tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in. Its mian purpose is to ensure the browser renders the page correctly by using the proper standards mode rather than  quirks mode.

A void element in HTML is an element that cannot have any child nodes or content—it only has a start tag and does not require (or allow) an end tag. These are sometimes called empty elements.

Examples of void elements include:
<br> (line break)
<img> (image)
<input> (input field)

(Element and Attributes)
HTML Elements are the building blocks of a webpage and consist of a start tag, content, and an end tag (for example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p>). Elements define what content appears on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, or links.
HTML Attributes provide additional information about elements and are always included in the opening tag. Attributes modify or control the behavior and appearance of elements. They are written as name/value pairs like name="value" (for example, <a href="https://example.com">Link</a>, where href is the attribute).

To insert invisible or formatting characters, such as non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;).

Specifying Document Information: They can define the character set, author, and other document-level metadata.
Controlling Viewport Settings: Meta tags are used to set the viewport for responsive web design, ensuring the page displays correctly on different devices.
Providing HTTP Headers: Meta tags can emulate HTTP respon…
